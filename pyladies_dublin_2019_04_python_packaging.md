# Timeline: Python Packaging

(In the wrong order and omitting bits to suit my narrative.)

(Mostly based on git or svn commit logs.)

---

# Problems We Need to Solve in 1995

* We need to distribute python libraries
* We need to find and install libraries (we have newsgroups!)
* We need to specify dependencies for a project (we don't know we need to do this yet)
* We clobber packages in the system (we don't know this is a bad thing yet)
* We need to use the latest and greatest versions of dependencies (sensibly)
* We need to stay sane

---

# cp -r
## Python 1.0 - 1995

```sh
cp somemodule.py myapp
cd myapp
python main.py
```

* Simple, works for most cases
* Pretty close to how I've built apps to ship to someone's desktop
* Advanced: cp -r
* Super advanced: python path .pth files

---

# distutils
## Python 1.5 - 1998

> In the beginning there was setup.py

(Well, there was Greg Ward in December 1998.)

* For packaging libraries, not so good for apps
* No dependency management
* Installs into python's `site-packages`

---

# distutils example

```python
from distutils.core import setup
setup(name="my_package", version="1.0", ...)
```

```sh
$ unzip my_package-1.0.zip
$ cd my_package-1.0
$ python setup.py install
```

---

# pypi
## Python 2.2 - 2002

Python Package Index (also known as the cheeseshop). Started by Richard Jones.

* Provided official central index to find python packages.
* First sprint in 2003 held on table beside the pypy project, very confusing (pypi and pypy)
* Original code derived from Roundup (the bug tracking tool used by Python)
* Still had to download and install packages manually
* Partially inspired by sites like freshmeat.net (really)

^ Yours truly was part of the original sprint

---

---

# Setuptools, eggs and easy_install
## Python 2.4 - 2004/2005

* Created by Phillip J Eby
* setuptools attempted many new ideas, some big improvements on distutils (`find_packages()`!)
* easy_install used parsing of pypi HTML to find and install dependencies
* eggs created to act like java jars for python. Current iteration of this idea are wheels. (AFAIK it's snake eggs and cheese wheels)
* Introduced dependencies specified in setup.py (including the `Django >= 1.2` syntax)

---

# virtualenv
## Python 2.5 - 2007

Exploited a neat trick: python looks for its libraries relative to the python binary. Could create symlinks from a copy of python back to system, creating an independent python install. Also created by Ian Bicking.

```
$ python -m venv /tmp/myenv
$ find /tmp/myenv
/tmp/myenv/bin/python3.7
/tmp/myenv/bin/activate
...
/tmp/myenv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/
$ . /tmp/myenv/bin/activate
$ which python
/tmp/myenv/bin/python
$ pip list
pip        10.0.1
setuptools 39.0.1
```

---

# pip
## Python 2.6 & Python 3.0 - 2008

Built on setuptools work to give us way to download and install packages. Previously called pyinstall. Started by Ian Bicking

$ pip install 'django<2.0'

# So far

* We've solved distributing python libraries
* We've solved finding and installing libraries
* We've solved specifying dependencies for a project
* We've solved clobbering system python

---

# Done? 
# Python development is perfect?

---

# Kinda

* `requirements.txt` a little fiddly to manage
    * `django==2.0.1` is better than `django>1.0` or even `django`
    * How do we update? e.g. `pip-tools` partially solves
* Each project has to figure out how to manage virtualenvs
    - Some impose patterns which are hard for some people to work with
* Security is opt in
* Lots of rough edges which required working around in large projects

---

# distribute
## Python 2.7 & Python 3.2 - 2011

* Phillip Eby had largely discontinued development of setuptools and easy_install at this point
* Python packaging efforts had somewhat stalled
* NPM, Gems and friends were doing cools stuff
* Tarek Ziad√© forked setuptools to reinvigorate project

---

# 2011: pypa

* Python Packaging Authority formed to take over maintenance of python packaging
* Works hard to update python packaging infrastructure (including pypi itself) from 2011 through to today
* Made the critical mistake of not picking "Ministry of Installation" as their name

---

# pipenv
## Python 3.6 - 2017

* Started by Kenneth Reitz
* Computer science solution: Add another layer of abstraction
* Handles pip and virtualenv for you
* Handles both high level dependencies (`Pipfile`) and specific versions (`Pipfile.lock`)
* More secure by default
* Nice little snake emoji
* And more!
